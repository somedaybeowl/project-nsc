- Guiding ANN (Loss function)
	> Recap supervised learning tasks: regression / classification
	> Loss functions variation
	> Roles of weights
	> Reducing loss with gradient descent

- Learning ANN (backpropagation)
	> Learning weights, backpropagation
	> Problem with step function
	> Updating weights, optimization point of view (+ Learning Rate)
